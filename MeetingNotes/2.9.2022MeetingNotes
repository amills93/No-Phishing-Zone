Team meeting
Attendance: 
[X] Adam Mills

[X] Dylan Redden

Think about different tasks that need to happen and put them on the task tracker.
Make an issue, assign it to someone, and then when they are finished close the task and then have them commit the changes to the Git Repo.
Current cards are top level issues -  convert them with the convert tool and then break them down. 
	This can be a few different issues from each of the larger issues.

Issues board and project board should be merged. Make them high level issues and then sub-level tasks.
More literature review:
-	Sources for project methodology (browser extensions, chrome). 
-	Good current sources but Dr. Hale wants to do more.
Anything in the Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM). 
Limit scope of project to any thing you can read off of from the BOM (history, JS particulars, user events, etc.). 
	Depending on the things we want to look at with this browser extension, then we can figure out what we specifically want to do.


What do we need to do for next week?
-	Have at least 8-9 literature review articles up on GitHub.
o	Drop summaries into a markdown file 
-	Risk list
-	Technical plan
o	We can put in to successively improve on the browser extension.
o	How will we decide if the extension will work right? Do a VM that uses google to pull up phishing sites and then test the extension?

-	Executive plan
-	Video for deliverable, does not have a specific format that we need to fit. 

By end of next week (2.18) write a hello world browser extension. Chrome developer and make one just to learn what is available and how that side of the project would work in general.
