# Project realization Progress report

Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved in milestone 3, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do.

Documentation towards project realization will come in the form a project report. Your project report should be placed on GitHub in the same repository you used for Milestones 1 and 2. Create a new markdown file called milestone-3.md that contains the following.

Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology since last milestone (Milestone 2).
* Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
* Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
* Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together
