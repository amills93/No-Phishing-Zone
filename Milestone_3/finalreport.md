# Final Report: Packaging and Release

An important part of developing or assessing a product is making the product or results accessible to those that might want to use it or them. This part of the final milestone tasks you with preparing your product, code, processes, and/or other relevant results for release by using relevant deployment strategies and by creating appropriate companion documentation. It is expected that every team will create a final report for release and review by partnering companies and organizations. All projects with code or other requirements must prepare a list of installation instructions and run instructions necessary to install and run any required apps. All projects examining existent systems must prepare a list of steps to reproduce their analysis.

## Code artifact Expectations
Polish your product by squashing as many bugs as possible and cleaning up the user interface.
Package your code and/or deployment environment for release using relevant deployment solutions such as github, docker, npm, bower, apt-get, Python pip, etc. The simplest deployment solution is creating a GitHub repository that is cloneable and has a few short install instructions. Other solutions like docker can be helpful in situations where the deployment environment context is complex or depends on certain versions of supporting software. Others like npm, bower, apt-get, or pip are useful for libraries that others might want to install or add to their own projects.
Create installation and getting started instructions using markdown in their repository or documentation to detail what an end-user must do to setup their app or product.
Results and findings Expectations
Summarize your results discovered over the life of the project.
Summarize findings as they relate to the original proposal in milestone 1. What worked, what didn't work? Where would future work be most useful?
The report should arrange documentation generated over the project timeline in a logical way that supports the summary. Think of the final report as a compilation of all of your work over the semester.
A suggested format for the final report is as follows:

# Project name
## Executive Summary
(overview of project, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Goals
(high level project goals, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Methodology
(specific methodology followed in the project, reuse from milestone 1/2, update if scope changed)

## Results / Findings
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?, list milestone 1/2/3 outcomes, make an effort to logically collect and organize the findings)

(bulleted lists can also be helpful to structure your results discussion)
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Install Instructions (if applicable)
### Requirements
(list of any software / hardware requirements necessary to run the code/app/etc)

### Installation Instructions
(list of steps to install the product/app/code/etc)

### Getting started
(list of any steps to run the code after installation and/or manage the apps over their lifecycle)

#### Submission materials
For this submission, you should submit your final report as a .md file called finalreport.md or README.md (to make it your default page) in your project GitHub repository. You should also convert the md file to pdf and upload it as finalreport.pdf for use on other non-web-based file stores.
