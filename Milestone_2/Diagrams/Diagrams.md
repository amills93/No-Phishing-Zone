In addition to the project documentation, you should produce a set of process or conceptual diagrams suited to your project. This could be a set of activity diagrams for penetration-testing oriented projects, it could be software architecture diagrams for development-oriented projects, or it could be a process/conceptual model for other projects.

For more information about different types of diagrams, see:

Submission materials
You should create your diagrams using an architectural tool such as Lucidchart, MS Visio, or similar tools. You should include the diagrams in your main project README.md file and in your Progress report in your GitHub repo, as images and (where appropriate) include links to Lucidchart/other platforms.
