Project realization - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology.
- Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
- Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
- Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together

The bulk of the project work is centered on realizing the methodology you defined in Milestone 1. Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do. Documentation towards project realization will come in the form an intermediate project report.
