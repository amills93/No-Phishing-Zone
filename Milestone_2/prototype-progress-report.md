Project realization - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology.
- Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
- Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
- Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together

The bulk of the project work is centered on realizing the methodology you defined in Milestone 1. Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do. Documentation towards project realization will come in the form an intermediate project report. 

# Progress Report (insert date here)
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)
Upon first identifying what the project could be, it was divided into several core technical hurdles

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

also list them out like this:
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Hinderances
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)

## Ongoing Risks

|Risk name (value)   | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Limited Timeline (48) | 8 | 6 | Project scope exceeds time considerations |
|Lack of Web Dev Experience (36) | 9 | 4 | As web development novices, problems might arise from this lack of expereince  |
|Scheduling Issues (18) | 6 | 3 | With each member having active personal, academic, and work lives, there might be issues coming together to meet and work |
|Product Ineffectiveness (8) | 4 | 2 | Despite earnest intentions, it is possible for an end product to not reach the desired usage functionality as originally intended  | 
|Chrome Extension Changes (10) | 10 | 1 | Should Google change their coding syntax, usage rights, or developer mode availability, the project would need to pivot elsewhere  |
