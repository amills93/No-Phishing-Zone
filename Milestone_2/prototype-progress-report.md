Project realization - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology.
- Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
- Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
- Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together

The bulk of the project work is centered on realizing the methodology you defined in Milestone 1. Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do. Documentation towards project realization will come in the form an intermediate project report. 

# Progress Report 4/10/2022
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)
After first identifying what the project could be, it was then divided into several core development modules.

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

also list them out like this:
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Hinderances
The intial challenge discovered was the extreme levels of obfuscation involved in modern web email services.  Our original assumptions about the human readability of such webmail services were a notable setback.  The DOM, once ingested, is not casually readable but needed further understanding of web development as well as better tooling for our development.  The tags within the DOM, even if readable, are unintuitive to a novice and thus required better tooling such as jQuery to filter through them.  The technical nature of ingesting the FROM email address of a given email also proved to be more difficult than imagined due to the intense obfuscation in the online mail client.

## Ongoing Risks

The table below is an updated version of what we first proposed in Milestone 1

|Risk name (value)   | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Limited Timeline (48) | 8 | 6 | Project scope exceeds time considerations |
|Lack of Web Dev Experience (36) | 9 | 4 | As web development novices, problems might arise from this lack of expereince  |
|Scheduling Issues (18) | 6 | 3 | With each member having active personal, academic, and work lives, there might be issues coming together to meet and work |
|Product Ineffectiveness (8) | 4 | 2 | Despite earnest intentions, it is possible for an end product to not reach the desired usage functionality as originally intended  | 
|Chrome Extension Changes (10) | 10 | 1 | Should Google change their coding syntax, usage rights, or developer mode availability, the project would need to pivot elsewhere  |
