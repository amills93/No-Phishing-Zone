### Frame issue of phishing as a behavioral problem.
-   Note disconnect between typical user action of clicking phishing link, and impacts/results that it has.
-   How it happens.
-   Why it happens.
-   Presentation of our main project idea.
-   Impacts we believe this will have in relationship to current state of user awareness and phishing attacks. 

# Section 2: Research and Project
//What our research found:

### Current available tools for fighting phishing and educating users.
-   Cluster types of defenses for phishing
-   Tools – those we found in our research

### User education – KnowBe4 and Google Web Etiquette trainings. 
-   Tools that we found in literature from our bibliography. 
-   Analysis of our research and what the current tech is.

### How we found current tools lacking.
-   How we wanted a tool that did what our tool does but did not find one.

//No-Phishing-Zone Explanation
### Full explanation of what No-Phishing-Zone browser extension will do and won’t do and why.
### How it works and what it looks for:
-   Run all URLs found in the email against “our” database (Phishtank or similar public repo).
-   Flag blacklist URLs for user to see 
-   Do nothing for whitelisted URLs

### Explain why we think our approach is beneficial, and how it would fix the behavioral issue earlier described.

# Section 3: Results
//What happened during our work on the project.

### Limitations we faced on the project.
-   How we came to only reading URLs from the DOM.
-   How/why we decided on Gmail email client.
-   Explain issues that we faced with Gmail obfuscation.
-   Coding issues around unknown languages and our inexperience with browser extensions.
-   List out issues that Christopher ran into with writing the add-on, and how we overcame them.
-   Why we think the tools we previously found/mentioned stopped where they did, due to the issues we have run into. 

### Future work.
-   Broaden repos that the extension compares URLs to. 
-   Become the Grammerly of phishing detection tools.

# Section 4: Conclusion
-   Overview of paper
