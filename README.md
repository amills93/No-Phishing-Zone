# Executive Project Summary

Phishing, smishing, vishingâ€¦ these attacks are often among the most simplistic to perform by malicious actors, and yet they can often have the most damaging consequences. Ransomware is on the rise, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era, but did you know that a huge portion of ransomware attacks start with a simple phish?
Most social engineering attacks follow the shotgun approach, meaning the attacker likes to send as many of them as possible in order to get a catch. Between a lack of focus and a lack security training, the average Joe is unlikely to spot the difference between a fake link and a real one.

No-Phishing-Zone is a Google Chrome extension designed to scan for commonly used social engineering tricks and identify suspicious sending domains, language, key triggers, and perform link validation while a user browses the internet. No-Phishing-Zone will flag those suspicious items and notify the user of the malicious intent leaving the option to continue up to the user. Often users are merely trying to live their lives and do things as quickly as possible, so any tool that helps them stay safe is a good one.

# Risk list
As you will probably discover, there are many things that can go wrong when working on a project. Issues with skillsets, technology, team member availability, etc, may arise as the project goes forward. As we discussed in class, there are three options available to deal with project management risks: monitor it (Watch it), mitigate it (do something about it), accept it (give up). For milestone one, you should identify the major sources of risk and what you plan to do about them. Prepare a risk list and rank them by risk level using the standard formula, i.e. `impact x likelihood`, to describe the top 5 risks that might affect your team's ability to pull off the tasks identified in your timeline and dictated by your objectives.

|Risk name (value)   | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Limited Timeline (24) | 8 | 3 | Project scope exceeds time considerations, see below  |
|Lack of Web Dev Experience (45) | 9 | 5 | As web development novices, problems might arise from this lack of expereince, see below  |
|Scheduling Issues (20) | 5 | 4 | With each member having active personal, academic, and work lives, there might be issues coming together to meet and work |
|Product Ineffectiveness (16) | 4 | 4 | Despite earnest intentions, it is possible for an end product to not reach the desired usage functionality as originally intended  | 
|Chrome Extension Changes (40) | 10 | 4 | Should Google change their coding syntax, usage rights, or developer mode availability, the project would need to pivot elsewhere  |

### Limited Timeline `TODO: impact x likelihood`
Due to the length of the semester we are limited to a little over 12 weeks of development time for our extension. In order to mitigate this risk we will utilize the principles of Agile for our software development and project management. Agile gives us the ability to monitor the progress of our project while giving us the ability to create and respond to change. With the agile method we will be able to monitor the progress of our project and adjust the scope as needed due to the timeline constraint of the semester.

### Lack of Web Dev Experience `TODO: impact x likelihood`
Our team has no knowledge in the development of Google Chrome Extensions however we will mitigate the risk by taking the introductory courses provided by Google on how to develop Chrome Extensions. We will also be using the principals of Agile for our software development and project management so we can dynamically react to change in the event developing a Chrome Extension proves more difficult than what we originally planned on. Google and the internet provide plenty of resources so we can mitigate the risk.
