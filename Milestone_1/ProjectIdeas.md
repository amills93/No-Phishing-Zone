### Team

Below is a list of specific subjects that I came across in my literature review that I believe would be worth our time to reserach for our project. 

Please add your own ideas and then we can vote on which one to use for the project.

## Ideas
a. Creating a worldwide acceptable phishing test, so that future browser extensions can be ran against it. There are currently lists of known websites,
but beyond a tool that would run them to all these sites and automate checking if a phishing attack is spotten or not, there is little more. 

b. Look developing a deep learning / AI tool to speed up analysis of URL verification. In the second article I reviewed this was listed as the next step 
that the researchers wished to take, and it seemed like a great idea. As new types of phishing attacks come out once current ones are proectected against,
this may be a novel way of protecting against future ideas. Fesability is an issue that I could see in pratical implimentaton of writing this, but the general 
outline could be developed with a test browser that could use a future tool that is developed with our outline.
