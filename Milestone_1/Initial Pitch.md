# CYBR4580/8950 Pitch 

## Title
No Phishing Zone

### Problem

Phishing, smishing, vishing… these attacks are often among the most simplistic to perform by malicious actors, and yet they can often have the most damaging consequences.  Ransomware is on the rise, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era, but did you know that a huge portion of ransomware attacks actually start with a simple phish?  
Most social engineering attacks follow the shotgun approach, meaning the attacker likes to send as many of them as possible in order to get a catch.  Between a lack of focus and a lack security training, the average Joe is unlikely to spot the difference between a fake link and a real one.

### Scope 

What I think we could do is a form of add-on that continuously scans for key social engineering factors.  These can be suspicious sending domains, suspicious language, key triggers, and even link validation.  Commercial-grade products like this exist, particularly on the enterprise level, but this could be a free package for anyone.  The add-on could be something like a Chrome extension or a add-on module for Outlook.

### Value Proposition

The value proposition is passively protecting people as they go about their business online.  John Doe may not understand that facebook.pdf is not really his bookmark to Facebook, but if it’s flagged in red he just may stop himself from clicking.  Often users are merely trying to live their lives and do things as quickly as possible, so any tool that helps them stay safe is a good one.  

### A Picture is worth a thousand words

A scanner that tips of the user for suspicious language, known keywords, and bad links.
