## About No-Phishing-Zone
No-Phishing-Zone is a Google Chrome extension designed to scan for commonly used social engineering tricks and identify suspicious sending domains and perform link validation while a user browses their Google Mail. No-Phishing-Zone will flag those suspicious items and notify the user of the malicious intent by highlighting the URL or Email as green or red, leaving the option to continue up to the user. Often users are merely trying to live their lives and do things as quickly as possible, so any tool that helps them stay safe is a good one. No-Phishing-Zone is meant to supplement a userâ€™s safe browsing habits and catch suspicious behaviors which may have slipped by them.
